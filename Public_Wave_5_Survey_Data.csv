My decisions about what I will do the next day are determined by these forecasts. The channel I watch usually includes the 14 to 90-day outlook you are curious about (however the Federal Govt map you showed actually shows an accurate legend unlike my local station). Any time the forecast is more than 2 to 4 days, it starts to be very inaccurate. My personal belief is we don't have a large enough base of data to accurately predict weather temperature and precipitation for 4 days out much less 14 to 90. Our data from the satellite era (about 50 years worth) is good, data before then is less helpful. And more the 150 years ago data pretty much doesn't exist. 150 years of depth with only 50 years being accurate enough to be useful is just not enough data to build a system on. 


NOW let's get into what would ACTUALLY happen. In 2020, we sent many good people home. Many of them did not return to work. People hired to replace these experienced weathermen are not just inexperienced, they are likely to have been hired because they are a minority group of some sort, NOT because they actually showed the ability to do the calculations required to predict weather. Meteorology is not an easy science to learn and I doubt the Federal Government did their due diligence to hire the best and brightest meteorologists to replace the people who retired during Covid. If the State of Oklahoma were hiring the people for this project, I am much more likely to trust they chose based on skills and ability to understand and learn about weather.
